We study the world by watching how people move through it.  
We test. We listen. We write. We read.  
We look for patterns that matter.  

Behind every data point, a person.  
Behind every person, a story.  
Behind every story, a reader.  

For those who believe data is more than digits.  
LÃ¯re is the eye on what's quietly shaping the world.
