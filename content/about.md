{{< figure src="/images/profile_hully.jpg" title="Hully Rolemberg" >}}
I am an econometrician, quantitative researcher and writer. I blend data analysis, behavioral science, and narrative to uncover the patterns behind decisions. I believe research should be rigorous, honest, and quietly transformative.

Former professional basketball athlete, now international marketer, photographer and globetrotter. My work brings a transversal and global perspective, with strong attention to detail and the patterns that often go unnoticed. I believe research is not linear - it is creative, observational, and always evolving.
